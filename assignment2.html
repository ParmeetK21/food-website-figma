<h2> Figma </h2>

<h3>Loading Page</h3>
<img src="Img2/S1.jpg" alt="loading page" width="1000" height="500">
<p>
    This page visually demonstrates to users what they may expect when the program completely loads and it is the first page in any kind of application. ’ Thought for food ’ is the name of the application. Icon and name both makes it clear to the user which kind of app user is about to use. This then helps the user decide if they want to keep using the app or not. Moreover, in some applications (game apps), it tells the user how long it would take to load inorder for the app to start. Icon is important as it assists the user to distinguish between apps. An appealing icon always adds up to the context.

</p>

<p>
    According to the three different key formats , tools were used. Statusbar and Home indicator were used for the iphone page load. Statusbar and Navigation were used for Android. App bar and Tab View were used for the desktop.
 
</p>


<h3> Login Page </h3>
<img src="Img2/S2.jpg" alt="login page" width="1000" height="500">
<p>

    This page is crucial as it asks for user’s information to access their accounts in the app. It behaves like a gateway to the app. This allows the user to proceed further. It asks for the phone number or email address through which the account is linked with its password. Also gives the user the option to sign up if the user hasn’t been registered before.

</p>
<p>
    Second page again represents the name of the application since the same app is being used and allows the user to enter its data to move further. First column gives the option for the user to either enter the phone number or username or the email. In the desktop screen, the Login step and the next step which is to register tends to combine together.


</p>


<h3> Set up Page</h3>
<img src="Img2/S3.jpg" alt="setup page" width="1000" height="500">

<p>
    

    This page asks the user to register for the application if the user is using this for the first time. This stores the information given by the user and makes sure only entering correct data will help the user access the application next time. Therefore, it assists the user to create an account. 

</p>

<p>
    The layout includes Full name, email address/phone number, location, username, new password and confirm password. This was done with the Text tool. Rectangle tool was used to make the columns. To round off the corners of the rectangle design options were adjusted and for the color change , the fill option was used.  


</p>

<h3>"Find a restaurant" Page</h3>
<img src="Img2/S4.jpg" alt="find a restaurant" width="1000" height="500">
<p>
    
This page offers the user a variety of options to select a restaurant in this case. Page starts with a dropdown option ( Settings ). Line tool was used for it. Top right corner of the page shows the picture of the user , which confirms the user has logged in. Search column wants the user to decide the place. Map image which is below the search column helps users to locate it on the map directly. Below that comes the recommend option, which makes it easier for the user to choose. 

</p>
<p>
    At the end of the page, the option bar is there which brings more options to the user. These steps were according to the iOS and Android formats. Desktop format is built differently. Firstly , it represents the same app throughout all the pages by having its name on it. Top right corner contains the user's id. In this format, the map is overlapped by the search column. It still allows the user to select a location. More recommendations options are shown at once to the user due to the large screen.

</p>
<h3> Individual Page</h3>
<img src="Img2/S5.jpg" alt="individual" width="1000" height="500">
<p>
    Previous page lets the user choose the option which brings them to the next page. On this page, precise and brief information about the restaurant is shown. It specifies the location, timings, and what type of food it has. An image related to the restaurant is added.  Next option is the review option. Latest reviews by people who had tried the restaurant are shown. A column below that allows the user to approach the review section. When a user clicks on the my review option, it takes the user to the next step
</p>
<p>
    This step and the next step is combined in the desktop mode. This mode lets the user have the information at once. 
</p>

<h3> Leave Review page </h3>
<img src="Img2/S6.jpg" alt="leave a review page" width="1000" height="500">

<p>
    This page is a continuation of the last one. Mandatory information on the last page such as the picture, location, timings and what type of food is still shown. This gives the user the opportunity to write a review instead of showing other people’s review. Instructions are provided saying 60 words are minimum. At the end of the page, another way of leaving a review is seen - stars. 


</p>
<p>
    In the desktop format, individual page and the review page are combined. This gives the user the option to see other reviews and type their own as well

</p>
<h3>Setting Page </h3>
<img src="Img2/S7.jpg" alt="setting page" width="1000" height="500">
<p>
    This page brings us to the setting page where users can play with different options if they want to. These options allow users to make changes accordingly. Clicking onto these options, more options are shown. For instance, accessibility mode opens more options like font sizes, colors , tone, TTS and languages to the user. On small screens, one has to click on the option they want, which in return will open a new page. On big screens, a dropdown menu would open. Therefore, accessing applications on bigger screens makes it easier for the users to choose and decide as one is able to grasp a lot of information at once.
